# Space Loading Issue Analysis

## Problem Description
When returning to space 1 from another space (like a building), the chunks are found in the cache but nothing is spawning in the world.

## Symptoms
1. The cache reports finding 14 chunks for the space
2. LoadChunksFromCache is called and processes 125 chunk positions
3. No chunks are actually found when trying to load them from cache
4. The player is teleported but sees an empty world

## Key Observations from Logs

### Chunk ID Mismatch
The system is looking for chunks with IDs like:
- `0x000000080600000008060000000806` (center at 8,8,8 + 2048 offset = 2054,2054,2054)

But the cache contains chunks with IDs like:
- `0x00000000080000000008000000000800` (2048,2048,2048)
- `0x0000000007ff00000008000000000800` (2047,2048,2048)
- `0x00000000080100000008010000000800` (2049,2049,2048)

### Coordinate System Issues
1. **LoadChunksFromCache** is called with center `(8,8,8)` and radius 2
2. This generates chunk positions from (6,6,6) to (10,10,10)
3. After adding the 2048 offset, it looks for chunks from (2054,2054,2054) to (2058,2058,2058)
4. But the actual chunks are centered around (2048,2048,2048)

## Potential Root Causes

### 1. Wrong Center Point
The code is using `LoadChunksFromCache(FIntVector(8, 8, 8), 2)` but should probably use a different center point that matches where the chunks actually are in the world.

### 2. Coordinate System Confusion
There might be multiple coordinate systems at play:
- **World coordinates**: Where blocks are placed in the game world
- **Chunk coordinates**: The chunk grid system
- **Dojo coordinates**: The blockchain storage coordinates

The conversion between these systems might be incorrect.

### 3. Cache Key Mismatch
The chunks might be stored in the cache with different keys than what's being searched for. The cache uses the full chunk ID including the hex prefix.

### 4. Owner/Space ID Issues
Although the logs show the correct space owner and ID, there might be a mismatch in how chunks are associated with spaces.

## Potential Solutions

### Solution 1: Use Correct Center Point
Instead of `(8,8,8)`, use the actual center of the cached chunks:
```cpp
LoadChunksFromCache(FIntVector(2048, 2048, 2048), 2);
```

### Solution 2: Calculate Center from Cache
Dynamically calculate the center point based on what's actually in the cache:
```cpp
// Find the center of all cached chunks
FIntVector CalculateCacheCenter(const FSpaceChunks& SpaceData)
{
    FIntVector Sum(0, 0, 0);
    int32 Count = 0;
    
    for (const auto& ChunkPair : SpaceData.Chunks)
    {
        FIntVector ChunkPos = HexStringToVector(ChunkPair.Key);
        Sum += ChunkPos;
        Count++;
    }
    
    return Count > 0 ? Sum / Count : FIntVector(2048, 2048, 2048);
}
```

### Solution 3: Remove Offset in Chunk ID Generation
The chunk IDs in cache don't seem to need the 2048 offset:
```cpp
FString ChunkId = FString::Printf(TEXT("0x%010x%010x%010x"),
    ChunkPos.X,
    ChunkPos.Y,
    ChunkPos.Z);
```

### Solution 4: Direct Cache Loading
Instead of calculating which chunks to load, directly load all chunks from the cache:
```cpp
void LoadAllChunksFromCache()
{
    FString IslandKey = GetCurrentIslandKey();
    if (!ChunkCache.Contains(IslandKey)) return;
    
    FSpaceChunks& SpaceData = ChunkCache[IslandKey];
    
    // Load all chunks
    for (const auto& ChunkPair : SpaceData.Chunks)
    {
        ProcessIslandChunk(ChunkPair.Value);
    }
    
    // Load all gatherables
    for (const auto& Pair : SpaceData.Gatherables)
    {
        ProcessGatherableResource(Pair.Value);
    }
    
    // Load all structures
    for (const auto& Pair : SpaceData.Structures)
    {
        ProcessWorldStructure(Pair.Value);
    }
}
```

## Debugging Steps

1. **Log the actual chunk positions**: When caching chunks, log their actual positions to understand the coordinate system
2. **Trace chunk processing**: Add logs in ProcessIslandChunk to see if it's being called and what happens
3. **Check actor spawning**: Verify that PlaceAssetInWorld is actually creating actors
4. **Verify cache integrity**: Make sure the chunk data in cache is valid and not corrupted

## Next Steps

1. Try Solution 4 (Direct Cache Loading) as it bypasses the coordinate calculation issue entirely
2. Add more logging to understand the chunk coordinate system
3. Verify that the chunk data contains valid block information (not all zeros)
4. Check if actors are being spawned but immediately destroyed or hidden
