You can open your inventory to craft items.

## First tools

Your first tools need one stick and a shaped stone.

To shape a stone, you need two stones. Pick the type of tool you want to shape and then remove the cubes one by one until you have the desired shape. Once you have the desired shape, you can place it in the crafting part of your inventory to make a tool.

## Furnace

Using charcoal, you can smelt items in the furnace.

The furnace must reach the right temperature to cook or smelt items.

### Food

Pot can be used to cook soup. To cook soup, place the pot in the furnace and add water and ingredients. Once the pot is cooked, you can remove it from the furnace and use it to cook soup.

### Minerals
