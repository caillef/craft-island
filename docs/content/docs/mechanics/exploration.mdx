The best way to find new resources is to explore new islands.

# How Exploration Works

Exploration is a key aspect of the game, allowing players to discover new resources and unlock new areas. To explore, players must request a new dimension. Once a new location is found, they can teleport to it using the portal.

During exploration, players can harvest resources to bring them back to their base. Be careful, your inventory is limited, so make sure to tidy up your inventory before starting a new exploration.

On these islands you can find :
- New tree types
- Rare minerals
- Hidden treasures
- Unique flora
