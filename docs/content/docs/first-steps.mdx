After launching the application, you will be presented with a welcome screen. From here, you will be redirected to the Cartridge Controller to login.

If this is a new account, you will spawn on an empty island. This is your new home.

Your first missions are :
- Collect stones and sticks to make your first tools.
- Chop down trees to get wood.
- Harvest wheats to sell it in the main island
- Build your house.
- Explore new islands to find more resources.

Build your island and share your progress with your friends on social media platforms using the share button.
